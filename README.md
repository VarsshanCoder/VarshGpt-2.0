## üß† How It Works

VarshGpt 2.0 is a client-side application that runs entirely in your browser. It leverages modern web technologies to provide a seamless experience:
*   The UI is built with **React** and **TypeScript**, styled with **Tailwind CSS**.
*   It communicates directly with the APIs of **Google Gemini**, **OpenAI**, and **DeepSeek**.
*   **Browser APIs** like `SpeechRecognition`, `SpeechSynthesis`, and `LocalStorage` are used for voice interaction and persistent memory.
*   The application is designed as a set of static files (`.html`, `.tsx`) and can be hosted on any static web hosting service.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*   **Frontend**: React, TypeScript
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
*   **AI APIs**: Google Gemini API, OpenAI API, DeepSeek API
*   **Browser APIs**: Web Speech API (SpeechRecognition & SpeechSynthesis), LocalStorage

## üöÄ Getting Started (Local Development)

This project is a static web application and does not require a complex build process.

### Prerequisites
*   A modern web browser.
*   A local web server to serve the files. The easiest way is to use `serve` via `npx`.

### Setup & Running the App

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/varshgpt-2.0.git
    cd varshgpt-2.0
    ```

2.  **Set up your Google Gemini API Key:**
    For core functionality like Gemini chat, search, and image generation to work, you must have a Google Gemini API Key.
    *   The application expects the Gemini key to be available in a non-version-controlled file. **The recommended way to provide this is to use the in-app settings modal.**
    *   **Note on `process.env`**: The code contains references to `process.env.API_KEY`. These are placeholders for a bundled environment. For this static setup, **you must use the in-app settings modal to configure your keys.**

3.  **Serve the application:**
    The simplest way to run the app locally is with the `serve` package.
    ```sh
    npx serve
    ```
    The application will be running on a local port (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Usage

For OpenAI and DeepSeek models to work, you must configure your API keys in the app.

1.  Click the **"API Keys"** button in the sidebar (settings icon).
2.  Enter your keys for **OpenAI** and **DeepSeek**. These are stored securely in your browser's session storage and are cleared when you close the tab.
3.  **(Optional)** Add custom API endpoints if you are using a proxy server to avoid browser CORS issues. This is often required for calling the OpenAI/DeepSeek APIs directly from the browser.
4.  **Personalize your experience** by filling out the "User Profile" textarea to get tailored AI responses.
